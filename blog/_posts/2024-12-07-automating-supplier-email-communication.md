## Background

Recently, a close friend who works as a Senior Procurement Officer at a company in Kuwait reached out to me. He explained that among his many responsibilities, one time-consuming daily task involves sending about 100 emails to various vendors. Each email requires a unique subject line containing the PO number and supplier name, along with a customized message body and specific attachment. He asked if there was a way to streamline this process.

The manual process took 1-2 hours daily, affecting productivity and focus on strategic tasks. The repetitive nature increased the risk of errors, leading to potential delays in procurement and supplier communication. During peak periods, manual email creation became a bottleneck, causing order processing delays. Additionally, there needed to be a standardized way to track sent emails, complicating record-keeping and follow-ups.
